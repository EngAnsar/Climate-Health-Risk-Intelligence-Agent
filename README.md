# 🌍 Climate & Health Risk Intelligence Agent  
### A Multi-Agent Environmental Decision Automation System  
Built with Python • AI Agents • LLMs • APIs • Data Engineering

---

## 🚀 Project Overview  
This project is an *autonomous multi-agent AI system* that analyzes environmental conditions, climate risks, public health stress, and citizen complaints — then generates *actionable recommendations* for city planners and local governments.

It was built as part of the  
*Google Developers – Agents Intensive (5-Day Capstone Program)*  
and submitted on Kaggle.

---

## 🧠 Multi-Agent Architecture  
The system uses *coordinated AI agents*, each performing a specific task:

### *1. AQI Agent (API + Synthetic Hybrid)*
- Fetches AQI from AQICN API  
- Computes 30-day AQI trend  
- Identifies pollution spikes & sensitive-group risks  

### *2. Weather Stress Agent (API)*
- Fetches temperature, humidity, and heat index  
- Detects heatwave-like stress  
- Supports health-risk evaluation  

### *3. Green Cover Agent*
- Analyzes NDVI-like grid (synthetic satellite data)  
- Detects low-green areas  
- Clusters planning priority zones  

### *4. Waste Hotspot Agent*
- Processes 40+ synthetic citizen complaints  
- Categorizes issues  
- Identifies hotspots and high-frequency complaint zones  

### *5. Health Risk & Advisory LLM Agent*
- Uses Gemini/OpenAI LLM  
- Evaluates environmental stress impacts  
- Gives actionable recommendations for:  
  - Asthma patients  
  - Elderly  
  - Outdoor workers  
  - Children  

### *6. Action Planner Agent*
- Combines outputs of all agents  
- Computes “priority score” (impact × feasibility)  
- Generates top 10 interventions  

### *7. Reporting Agent*
- Generates combined JSON output  
- Prepares AQI charts + NDVI heatmaps (PNG)  
- Optional: HTML report (Kaggle-safe)

---

## 🌟 Key Capabilities  
- Converts climate signals into *actionable decisions*  
- Works even with *synthetic fallback data* if API keys unavailable  
- Fully reproducible on Kaggle  
- Produces *human-friendly insights* through LLM reasoning  
- AI-based automation reduces:  
  - Data collection time → 5–10 hours saved  
  - Analysis time → ~35 minutes  
  - Decision making → < 5 minutes
